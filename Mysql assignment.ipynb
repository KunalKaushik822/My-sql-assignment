    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Structure: Data is organized in tables with rows and columns, like a spreadsheet. Tables are linked together through relationships, making them ideal for complex queries involving data from multiple tables.\n",
    "# Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema, which dictates the structure and data types of each table. This ensures consistency and data integrity.\n",
    "# Language: Uses a standardized language called SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with the database. SQL allows for complex queries to retrieve specific data sets based on conditions.\n",
    "# Applications: Well-suited for scenarios where data structure is well-defined and needs to remain consistent, like financial transactions or customer relationship management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Structure: More flexible structure compared to SQL. Data can be stored in various formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. This makes them adaptable to evolving data models.\n",
    "# Schema: Often have a schema-less design or a flexible schema, allowing for easier integration of new data types without altering the entire structure.\n",
    "# Language: Doesn't rely on a single language for interaction. The specific query language varies depending on the type of NoSQL database (e.g., document-oriented databases might use JSON).\n",
    "# Applications: Ideal for storing large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, like social media posts, sensor data, or product catalogs. They also excel in handling big data applications."

    "# SQL\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "  CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "  ContactName VARCHAR(255),\n",

    "# This code creates a new table named \"Customers\" with four columns: CustomerID (integer, primary key), CustomerName (text, not null), ContactName (text), and City (text).\n",

    "# DROP: This powerful command permanently removes a database object from the database.  Use it with caution, as dropped objects cannot be recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# SQL\n",
    "# DROP TABLE Orders;\n",
    "# Use code with caution.\n",
    "# This code permanently deletes the table named \"Orders\" from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ALTER: This command allows you to modify the structure of existing database objects. You can use it to add, delete, or modify columns, change data types, and add constraints.\n",

    "# SQL\n",
    "# ALTER TABLE Customers ADD Country VARCHAR(50);\n",

    "# SQL\n",

    "# Use code with caution.\n",
    "# This code inserts a new row into the \"Customers\" table with the specified values for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "# UPDATE: This command allows you to modify existing data within a table. You can update specific columns based on a condition that identifies the rows to be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# SQL\n",
    "# UPDATE Customers SET City = 'Los Angeles' WHERE CustomerID = 1002;\n",
    "# Use code with caution.\n",
    "# This code updates the \"City\" column for the customer with CustomerID 1002, changing it to \"Los Angeles\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# DELETE: This command removes existing rows of data from a table. Similar to UPDATE, you can use a WHERE clause to specify the condition for deleting rows.\n",
